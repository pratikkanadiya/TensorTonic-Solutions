#Expected Value (Discrete Distribution)
Compute the expected value of a discrete random variable given its values and probabilities.

Mathematical Definition
Expected Value:
  E[X] = sum i =0 to N-1 (xi * pi)

where xi are the values and pi are their corresponding probabilities with ∑pi=1.

Function Arguments
x: array-like, shape (N,) - possible values
p: array-like, shape (N,) - corresponding probabilities

#Example :
  Input: x = [1, 2, 3], p = [0.2, 0.5, 0.3]
  Output: E[X] = 2.1

Constraints :
  1 ≤ N ≤ 10,000
  NumPy only
